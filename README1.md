# Homework
- In this project i had to refracter a wepage to make it look more clean.
- First i wanted to clean up the html so that i could read it better, and also along with the css.
- After i got the html, and the css organized i began to fix up the page and the looks.
- I wanted a look that would catch someones eye by first sight.
- I fixed how the buttons work, and then began to look over some fonts for the page. I also changed up some of boxes and changed the size so that everything would fit better.
